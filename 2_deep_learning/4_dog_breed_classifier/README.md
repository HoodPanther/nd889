# Project 4: Dog Breed Classifier

For this project we were tasked with training a CNN to detect breeds of dogs.

See my [dog_app.ipynb](./dog_app.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook, or the Mobile App I made called [What Dog?](https://github.com/madhavajay/what-dog), to use the Keras Dog Classifier model for real time inference on iOS and Android.
