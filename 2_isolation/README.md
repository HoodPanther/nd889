# Build a Game-Playing Agent

For the AIND Project 2: Build a Game-Playing Agent, we were introduced to the game Isolation and the concepts of Minimax tree search and Alpha-Beta pruning.

In addition we were asked to develop our own heuristics to attempt to beat the supplied heuristics. This was more difficult than expected and illustrated the tradeoff between a heuristic complexity and speed when used for tree search.

## Instructions

* Switch to Python 3.6 or greater environment

* Install necessary dependencies:
```bash
$ pip install termcolor
```

* Play against AI.
```bash
$ python play.py
```

* Run tests:
```bash
$ pytest
```

* Run genetic algorithm:
```bash
$ python pit.py
```
